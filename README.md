Mastermind Console Game
This is a console-based implementation of the Mastermind game. The program generates a secret code consisting of a sequence of colors, and the player's objective is to guess the code within a limited number of attempts.

Requirements
Python 3.6

Instructions
Clone or download this repository to your computer.
Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the program is located.
Run the following command to start the game:
Copy
python mastermind.py or python3 matermind.py

Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.
Try to guess the hidden code by entering the corresponding colors as prompted.
After each guess, you will receive feedback in the form of plus ('+') and minus ('-') signs.
A plus sign indicates a correct color in the correct position.
A minus sign indicates a correct color but in the wrong position.
Keep guessing until you correctly deduce the code or exhaust all the attempts.
Game Rules
The game consists of guessing a combination of colors.
The secret code is composed of 4 colors chosen from a predefined palette.
The available colors are: red, blue, green, yellow, orange, and purple.
After each guess, the program will provide feedback in the form of plus and minus signs.
Use the feedback to deduce the code in the fewest number of attempts.
You have a limited number of attempts to guess the code. The challenge is to guess it before running out of attempts!

Customization
You can customize the number of attempts by modifying the max_attempts variable in the mastermind.py file.
You can customize the length of the code by modifying the code_length variable in the mastermind.py file.
You can customize the color palette by modifying the valid_colors list in the mastermind.py file.
You can customize the surrendation by modifying the number in the surrender validation in the mastermind.py file.
Contributions
Contributions are welcome. If you encounter any issues or have an improvement for the program, you can open an issue or submit a pull request on the GitHub repository.
